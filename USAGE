PilotAltimeter (Garmin ConnectIQ) Widget
========================================
Usage instructions


   !!! WARNING !!! DISCLAIMER !!! WARNING !!! DISCLAIMER !!! WARNING !!!

   THIS APPLICATION IS NOT TO BE USED AS A MEAN TO INSURE FLIGHT SAFETY.

  Always follow official or recommended procedures to insure flight safety,
         *independently* from the help this application can offer.

  In particular, this application relies on barometric pressure to derive
  the altitude and MUST NOT BE USED IN A PRESSURIZED AIRCRAFT.

Global View
-----------

PilotAltimeter displays altitude data in multiple view, which you can switch
thanks to the SELECT button:
 - AMSL (Above Mean Sea Level) Altitude, based on user-specified QNH:
   [top] Actual altitude
   [bottom] QNH
 - Flight Level/Altitude, based on standard QNE (1013.25hPa)
   [top] Flight level (FL...)
   [bottom] Standard altitude
 - AGL (Above Ground Level) Height, based on user-specified reference elevation
   [top] Height
   [bottom] Reference elevation
 - Density Altitude, taking into account QFE and temperature
   [top] Density altitude
   [bottom] temperature and ISA offset
 - Pressure readings
   [top] Calibrated and low-pass filtered QFE
   [bottom] Raw sensor QFE


Settings
--------

Enter the Settings menu by pressing the MENU button (long-pressing the UP button).

You may then specify the following settings:
 - Calibration -> QNH:
   calibrate the altimeter using the current known QNH
 - Calibration -> Elevation:
   calibrate the altimeter using the current known elevation
   (QNH shall be adjusted accordingly)
 - Reference -> Elevation
   set the reference elevation for AGL (Above Ground Level) height calculation
 - Reference -> Temperature
   set the current external temperature for Density Altitude calculation
   (the offset to the standard ISA temperature shall be saved internally)
 - Reference -> Temperature Source
   whether to use the temperature "set" by the user or that "auto"-matically
   obtained from the device; REQUIRES AN EXTERNAL SENSOR (e.g. Garmin Tempe)
 - General -> Time Constant:
   time constants (in seconds) used for exponentially averaging (EMA) the
   device's sensor input
 - General -> Background Color:
   the background color
 - Units -> Elevation Unit:
   preferred units for displaying elevation/altitude values
 - Units -> Pressure Unit:
   preferred units for displaying pressure values
 - Units -> Temperature Unit:
   preferred units for displaying temperature values
 - Units -> Timezone:
   display Local Time (LT) or Universal Time Coordinates (UTC/Z)
 - Correction -> Absolute:
   set the absolute device's sensor error correction
 - Correction -> Relative:
   set the relative device's sensor error correction


Measurement and Calculation Methods
-----------------------------------

PilotAltimeter relies on ConnectIQ's Activity.Info:rawAmbientPressure reading,
namely (hopefully) the raw barometric pressure (QFE) as measured by the device's
sensor.

QNH and altitude (ALT) calculation is then performed using the official ICAO
formulas, as documented in ICAO Doc 9837 "Manual on Automatic Meteorological
Observing Systems at Aerodromes":

  https://store.icao.int/manual-on-automatic-meteorological-observing-systems-at-aerodromes-2011-doc-9837-english-printed.html

Namely:

  1.   ALTisa = 44330.77 âˆ’ 11880.32 * QFE^0.190263

  2.a  QNH  = 1013.25 * (1 - 0.0065 * (ALTisa - ALT) / 288.15)^5.25588

  2.b  ALT  = ALTisa - 288.15 * (1 - (QNH / 1013.25)^0.190263) / 0.0065


Calibrating the Device Sensor
-----------------------------

PilotAltimeter allows you to calibrate/correct your device's barometric sensor
using the following formulas:

   QFEcalibrated = QFEsensor * Crel + Cabs

If you suspect your device's sensor is inaccurate, you shall:

1. take down multiple QFE readings, at different altitude, using your device's
   *raw* QFE and a reliable, calibrated, reference barometer

2. import those readings in a LibreOffice Calc (or Microsoft Excel) spreadsheet
   and obtain the Crel and Cabs coefficients by performing a linear regression:

     https://help.libreoffice.org/Calc/Regression_Analysis
     where Crel = Slope and Cabs = Intercept

   (curve-fitting for dummies: https://xkcd.com/2048/)

3. set Correction -> Relative/Absolute values to the calculated coefficients

Not an easy feat. But if you must...
